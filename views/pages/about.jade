      h3 Who is it for?
      p
        | Magic is not for the faint of heart.
        | It is built by programmers for programmers.

      p
        | This page was built with the help of 
        a(href='https://github.com/express-magic/express-magic' target='_blank') magic
      
      p

    article#magic
      header
        h4 Magic
      
      p
        | in essence, Magic is an express app mounter.

      p
        | it is designed not to be used.
      p
        | it's goal is to magically reduce all the tedious boilerplate
        | that usually has to be written to get an express app running. 
      p
        | All you need to enable Magic in your app is a main.js file:
        pre.highlight
          code.
            require('express-magic')();

    article#hosts
      header
        h4 Hosts:
      p
        | A host is a collection of templates, designed to be served together.
        | One host is a completely independent express application and it can do
        | anything express can do, but most of the time while reducing boilerplate.
        
      p
        | a host consists of 5 lines of javascript, because i like to be verbose:
        pre.highlight
          code.
            'use strict';
            var express = require('express')
              , H = express()
            ;
            //custom functionality, 
            //load express modules, use them, add routes etc.
            module.exports = H;
      p
        | of course you can be less verbose too:
        pre.highlight
          code.
            module.exports = require('express')();
      p
        | The rest of the magic is completely up to you,
        | you can add any kind of express functionality in your hosts,
        |  install a database, or any other npm module.

    article#middleware
      header
        h4 Express Middlewares
      p
        | There are some helpers for connect middlewares.
        pre.highlight
          code.
            var H = require('express')();
            H.enable('bodyParser');
            H.enable('cookieParser');
            //there are more, documentation will follow.

        | If you use magic-express and find a middleware that is not supported
        | just file an 
        a(href='https://github.com/express-magic/express-magic/issues') issue
        |  on github and we will add it.

        | It comes with all the Makefiles, Dockerfiles and what not you need 
        | to instantly start working on your own content.
        | just go into the hosts directory, change the Makefile to 
        | git clone your custom host directories or clone and use
